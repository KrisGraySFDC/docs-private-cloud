Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition provides two installation modes:

* GUI-based
* CLI-based

The GUI based installer requires extra ports to be opened and a web browser to access the pages. 
It's interactive and it walks you through a set of wizard pages that enable you to specify configuration options.

The Command line based installer does not require human interaction using a web browser, it is useful for automation.
