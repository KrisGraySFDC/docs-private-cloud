There are two ways to install Anypoint Private Cloud Edition:

* Using a GUI installer.
* Using the CLI.

The GUI based installer requires you to open extra ports and a web browser to access the pages.
The installer is interactive and walks you through a set of wizard pages that enable you to specify configuration options.

The CLI installer does not require human interaction using a web browser and is useful for automation.
