If not completed prior to Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition installation, the following steps must be performed before you can deploy and manage applications, register APIs, and use API Exchange on an Anypoint Platform environment running on your own local network:

* xref:access-management-dns.adoc[Configure DNS on Anypoint Private Cloud]
* xref:access-management-security.adoc[Configure Security on Anypoint Private Cloud]
* xref:access-management-SMTP.adoc[Configure SMTP in Anypoint Private Cloud]
* xref:install-config-ldap-pce.adoc[Configure an External Identity Provider in Anypoint Private Cloud]
* xref:install-create-lb.adoc[Set up a Load Balancer]

[NOTE]
At the time of this writing, some Docker containers must run as root. Processes running as root do not expose functionality outside the cluster. 
Processes that serve external traffic do not run as root, to maximize security.
