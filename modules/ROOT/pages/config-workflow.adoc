The following tasks are required after you complete Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition installation. Otherwise, you cannot deploy and manage applications, register APIs, and use API Exchange on an Anypoint Platform environment running on your own local network.

* If you used the GUI installer, close port 61009 in the cluster security group. If you are using AWS, you can use the AWS Web console to do this.

[NOTE]
At the time of this writing, some Docker containers must run as root. Processes running as root do not expose functionality outside the cluster. 
Processes that serve external traffic do not run as root, to maximize security.
