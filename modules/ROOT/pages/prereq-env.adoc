Adhere to the follow recommendations and limitations when setting up your environment and deploying apps:

* Environment:

** Production: 6 Nodes of 8 cores and 32GB 

* Sizing

** ARM:

*** Applications per Environment 

**** Less than 200 

***** Maximum: 500 Applications in a single environment 
**** Number of Clusters/Runtimes

***** Total: 800 runtimes 2 nodes each with 400 Clusters 
**** Applications per Mule Runtime or Cluster

***** Production: Maximum of 50 apps 
***** Development: Maximum of 100 apps
***** Recommended: Less than 25 apps
** API Platform

*** APIs under management

**** Limit each management plane 2.0.0 cluster to 20000 (6 nodes, 16 cores) APIs under management and 10000 (6 nodes 8 cores), 
in which:

***** A single API implementation with one policy counts as 0.3.
***** A single clustered proxy with up to 5 policies counts as 1.
***** Every runtime is polling every 60 seconds.
