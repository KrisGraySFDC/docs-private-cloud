The Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition includes the following application components when combined with CloudHub functionality:

* Runtime Manager, which enables you to track and manage your deployed Mule applications.
* API Manager, which enables you to manage your registered APIs.
* Anypoint Exchange, which enables your organization to share various assets for reuse across integration projects.
* Access Management
* Design Center, excluding Flow Designer

The following application components are not included when combined with CloudHub functionality:

* Analytics - Insights
* Analytics - Visualizer
* Analytics - API
* Anypoint Monitoring
