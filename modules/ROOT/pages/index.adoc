With Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you run and manage Mule applications on your local servers, using your required security policies. When running Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, MuleSoft systems do not interact with your data. You configure and run the software, and maintain all data storage, processing, and transmission.

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition uses Docker and Kubernetes to provide built-in high availability and scalability. You can install the platform without understanding Docker or Kubernetes, but you must understand how they work to manage and troubleshoot the platform.
