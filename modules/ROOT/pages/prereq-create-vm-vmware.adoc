After finishing, VMWare displays the properties of your virtual machine similar to the following:

Next, you must add the three other devices required for installation (HDD2, HDD3 and HDD4). To add devices, click the "Add..." button, and select "Hard Disk":

When finished adding the disk, create another disk for HDD3. This disk should be at least 250GB:
