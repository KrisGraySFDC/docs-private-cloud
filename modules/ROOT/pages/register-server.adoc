[[registering_servers]]

Before registering a server, you must configure Mule to trust the TLS certificates you configured:

1. Get the public certificate for you server.
2. Add the certificate to the trustore of the JVM you are using for the Mule runtime.

Example:

----
$ keytool -printcert -sslserver $ANYPOINT_DNS:443 -rfc > /tmp/anypoint.crt
$ keytool -importcert -alias anypoint.my-company -keystore /etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts -storepass changeit -file /tmp/anypoint.crt
----

In this example, $ANYPOINT_DNS should be set to your DNS for Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.
Replace the location and password for your JVM's trustore for your environment.
